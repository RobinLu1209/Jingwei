## How to Train and Test Jingwei

To run the code, simply execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will run the code with the default parameters. If you want to customize the parameters, you can pass them via the command line. Below are the available command-line arguments you can set.

| `--max_patience`      | `int`    | 10       | Maximum patience for early stopping.                 |
| `--lr`                | `float`  | 0.1      | Learning rate for training.                          |
| `--num_epochs`        | `int`    | 1000     | Number of epochs for training.                       |
| `--gpu`               | `int`    | 0        | GPU index to use for training (0 for the first GPU). |
| `--geo_dim`           | `int`    | 5        | Dimension of the DO geo factor.                      |
| `--hidden_dim`        | `int`    | 64       | Dimension of the hidden layer.                       |
| `--time_length`       | `int`    | 11       | Length of the time series.                           |

## The Name of "Jingwei"

[Jingwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingwei) is a classic figure in Chinese mythology, featured in the ["Shan Hai Jing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingwei). 
The story tells of Jingwei, the daughter of Emperor Yan, who drowned in the East Sea. She was reborn as a bird and decided to fill the sea with pebbles and twigs, endeavoring to prevent similar tragedies. Today, Jingwei symbolizes perseverance and determination, embodying the spirit of never giving up despite difficult challenges.

In our work, we thank all marine scientists, researchers, and technicians who tirelessly venture into the field to measure oceanic dissolved oxygen data. Although their collected data might seem as extremely sparse as the pebbles and twigs Jingwei used, their persistent efforts aim to reveal the patterns of global ocean deoxygenation. To honor the spirit of these ocean explorers, we have named the AI-driven algorithm for reconstructing ocean deoxygenation proposed in this paper "Jingwei" and designed its logo as follows.
